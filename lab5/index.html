	<h2>Difficulties</h2>
	<p> I found that the task 3 was challenging for me. I had to implement some new html that I have never
	used before. I sort of combined the two new types of html that were in the lecture to create list
with links that open into a new tab. It was a bit intimidating at first, but ultimately ended up working when
opening the page in my browser on the very first try.</p>

	<div id="Results">
		<h2>Results</h2>
		<p>I'm really happy with the results from this lab. I was able to create linked words within an ordered list,
		as well as creating linked images, that all open into a new tab.</p>
