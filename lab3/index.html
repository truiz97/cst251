	<h2>Difficulties</h2>
	<p> This lab has not been too difficult for me, only because of the fact that I had already
		 done some of the lab work beforehand. There are some techniques I would like to learn
		  though. I want to know how to format my text on the landing page for my site. Which,
			probably isn't too tricky. I just haven't taken the time to watch any tutorials yet
			Below in my html for my landing page, with my labs added in.</p>

		<h2>Results</h2>
		<p> I'm really pleased with my results from this lab, especially because
			of the fact that I find this class very interesting. I really enjoyed adding my
			image to my landing page. As well as adjusting the size to my likings.</p>
