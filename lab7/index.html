<h2>Challenges</h2>
	<p> This whole lab was challenging. Mostly because it was my first time working CSS. Although
			it was challegning, I actually had a lot of fun. There was alot of expermientation. I wanted to implement alot of the information from the lectures.
			A part of me wanted to just rely on using id's for the selectors. I would have done this, but I wanted to practice using other methods because of the fact that
			Wes urged us to not always rely on writing our own html. I think for the next Lab i'll try using more id selectors.

<div id=Problems>
<h3>Problems</h3>
	<p> I was running into several problems, that were honestly small mistakes on my behalf. One was leaving
		 a hyphen out of one of my properties of my header 1 selector. I was relieved to find out it was such a small mistake, after
		 back tracking my every step and spending 25 mintues on W3 Schools refreshing my memory on CSS. Another problem that I had to solve was
		 aligning my h1 to the cetner of the page. At first, I was trying to add my align center property within my head class property. When this failed to work,
		 I created a new h1 selector and aligned the text with this new recipe instead. This was successful.

<div id=Results>
<h4>Results</h4>
	<p>I'm actually loving the results. It's still somewhat barebone for my taste. It's a start though!
		 I'm excited to explore CSS more, especially
		 once I get the basics down.
